        <h3>Galton Board</h3>
        <p><a href="./galton/index.html">This simulation</a> models a simple Galton Board setup, showing how the probabilities of a ball bouncing randomly left or right lead to something resembling a bell curve distribution. I dreamed this project up to try out different animation approaches.</p>

        <h3>The Race #1</h3>
        <p><a href="./theRace01/index.html">This simulation</a> models a parallel operation network with one shared resource. Decide how often the resource needs to switch tasks, in order to maximise the throughput of the system.</p>
        <p>Based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints">TOC</a> workbook scenario to highlight the impact of individual performance measures.</p>

        <h3>The Race #2</h3>
        <p><a href="./theRace02/index.html">This simulation</a> models a serial operation network with one shared resource. As above, decide how often the resource needs to switch tasks, in order to maximise the throughput of the system.</p>

        <h3>Stopwatch control</h3>
        <p><a href="./stopwatch/index.html">This simulation</a> is more about how to control animations using user-input. It prototypes a Stopwatch component that displays itself, and responds to user-events. It can handle the timing of simulated tasks via CSS animation events.</p>
