    <h3>The purpose of the simulation:</h3>
    <p>You have two days (16 hours) to produce as much product as possible without running out of cash.</p>
    <p>The operation has five processes (circles) and six stores (rectangles).
    Each process moves units of work from one store to the next. Four workers (three red and one blue) operate the processes.</p>
    <p>The bottom left store is raw material (RM). RM costs $100 per unit.
    The bottom right store is the finished goods, which sell for $300 each.
    Purchases and sales happen immediately.</p>
    <p>Expenses of $4000 are due to be paid at the end of each day (every 8 hours.)
    You start with $2000 cash, so you need to make at least another $6000 over RM costs to stay solvent.</p>
    <p>The dedicated red workers each take 10 minutes to process one unit.
    The blue worker takes only 1 minute per unit, but has two processes to operate.
    It takes 60 minutes for the blue worker to change jobs.</p>
    <p>Your task is to purchase RM as required, and to decide when the blue worker should switch between its two processes. Enjoy!</p>
