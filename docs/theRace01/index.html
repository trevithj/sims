    <h3>The purpose of the simulation:</h3>
    <p>You have eight hours to produce as much product as possible without running out of cash.</p>
    <p>The operation has four processes (circles) and six stores (rectangles).
    Each process moves units of work from the store below to the store above. Three workers (two red and one blue) operate the processes.</p>
    <p>The bottom stores are raw material (RM). RM costs $50 for 5 units.
    The top stores are the finished goods, which sell for $30 each.
    Purchases and sales happen immediately.</p>
    <p>Expenses of $4000 are due to be paid at 08:00.
    You start with $1000 cash, so you need to make at least another $3000 over RM costs.</p>
    <p>The dedicated red workers each take 4 minutes to process one unit.
    The blue worker takes only 1 minute per unit, but has two processes to operate.
    It takes 30 minutes for the blue worker to change jobs.</p>
    <p>Your task is to purchase RM as required, and to decide when the blue worker should switch between its two processes. Enjoy!</p>
